== What for? ==

Let user page titles and links to user pages be gender-specific.

== Why? ==

MediaWiki 1.18.0 introduced $wgExtraGenderNamespaces, but it does only part of the job. If you set
up $wgExtraGenderNamespaces properly, tooltips of links to user pages and user page titles are
genderized, but link text and namespace tab are not. This extension let $wgExtraGenderNamespaces do
its part of the job and does the rest.

I believe some day all the functionality will be implemented in MediaWiki core and the Genderize
extension will be obsolete. But for MediaWiki 1.18.x the Genderize fills the gap.

== Download ==

 svn checkout http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/Genderize

== Usage ==

Add to your LocalSettings.php:

 // $egGenderize should be set *before* including `Genderize.php'.
 $egGenderize[ 'male'    ] = 'Male';     // Replace Male, Female,
 $egGenderize[ 'female'  ] = 'Female';   // and Unknown with  proper words
 $egGenderize[ 'unknown' ] = 'Unknown';  // in wiki content language.
 // Do *not* change $wgExtraGenderNamespaces[ NS_USER ].
 // Include extension file:
 require_once( 'path-to-extension/Genderize.php' );

If $egGender is not set, English `User' is used instead.

== Effect ==

(Let us assume $egGenderize is set as in the example above.)

Links to a user page can be specified as [[Male:Name]], [[Female:Name]], or [[Unknown:Name]], or as
canonical [[User:Name]]. Regardless of the used prefix, link will be rendered with proper prefix.

User page title will be genderized, e. g. `Female:Name'. Namespace tab (in case of Vector skin it is
above the left-upper corner of the page) will be `Female', not `User'.

== Known issues ==

Some messages are not translated yet. For example, namespace's tab tooltip.
