== What for? ==

Let user page titles and links to user pages be gender-specific.

== Why? ==

MediaWiki 1.18.0 introduced $wgExtraGenderNamespaces for it. Yes, but it does only 1/4 of the job.
If you set up $wgExtraGenderNamespaces properly, tooltips of links to user pages are genderized.
But link text, user page title and namespace tab are not. This extension let
$wgExtraGenderNamespaces do its part of the job and does the rest.

== Usage ==

 // $egGenderize should be set *before* including `Genderize.php'.
 $egGenderize[ 'male'    ] = 'Male';
 $egGenderize[ 'female'  ] = 'Female';
 $egGenderize[ 'unknown' ] = 'Unknown';
 require_once( '.../Genderize.php' );

If $egGender is not set, English `User' is used instead.

== Effect ==

(Let us assume $egGenderize is set as in the example above.)

Li—Çks to a user page can be specified as [[Male:Name]], [[Female:Name]], or [[Unknown:Name]], or as
canonical [[User:Name]]. Regardless of the used prefix, link will be rendered with proper prefix.

User page title will be genderized, e. g. `Female:Name'. Namespace tab (in case of Vector skin it
is above the left-upper corner of the page) will be `Female', not `User'.  
 
== Known issues ==

Some messages are not translated yet. For example, namespace's tab tooltip.
