== Purpose ==

The `HidePrefix' extension hides prefix in links and page titles.

For example, wikitext `[[Help:How to]]' normally results in link `Help:How to'. If this extension is
enabled, result will be just `How to' without `Help:' prefix.

Links to pages with the same name but in different namespaces can be distinguished by tooltips.

Again, article `How to' in `Help' namespece normally has `Help:How to' page title. If this extension
is enabled, visible page title will be just `How to', without `Help:' prefix.

Pages with the same name in different namespaces can be distinguished by its namespace tab.
