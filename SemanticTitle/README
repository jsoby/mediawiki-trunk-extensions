== Purpose ==

The `SemanticTitle' extension allows set link text and page title to a value of a semantic property.

The extension is useful for pages, which names are automatically generated by a formula
(e. g. auto-incremented numbers or ids), but human-readable title is still desirable.

== Usage ==

Add to your `LocalSettings.php':

 require_once( 'SemanticTitle.php' );
 $egSemanticTitle[ NS ] = 'Property name';
 ...

where:

* ''NS'' is a namespace index (not namespace name!), for example, `NS_MAIN' or `NS_USER'.
* ''Property name'' â€” a name of semantic property to be used as page title.

If a page in the specified namespace has the specified property (which should be of type `String'),
the visible title of the page is changed to the value of the property.

The actual name of page is added to the beginning of page subtitle.

'''Note:''' The extension changes only ''visible'' name, it does ot change real name of the page.

== Caveats ==

`SematicTitle' overrides page title set by SemanticForms (specified by `edit title' parameter of
`{{{info ...}}}' construct).

* `Special:AllPages' shows unsorted list of pages (they are sorted in order of they real titles).
